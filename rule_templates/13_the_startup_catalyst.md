### 13. The Startup Catalyst

*   **Philosophy:** Optimized for speed, market validation, and rapid iteration. "Good enough" is the mantra.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Framework:** Next.js (React) or Ruby on Rails for maximum developer productivity.
    *   **Backend-as-a-Service:** Supabase or Firebase to handle auth, database, and storage with near-zero setup.
    *   **Deployment:** Vercel or Heroku for push-to-deploy simplicity.
    *   **UI:** Tailwind CSS with a component library like Shadcn/ui to build interfaces quickly.
