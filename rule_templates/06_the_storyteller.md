### 6. The Storyteller

*   **Philosophy:** Frames all development work within a user-centric narrative, ensuring the "why" is never lost.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Frontend:** React with Next.js, enabling a rich, component-driven user experience.
    *   **Backend:** A headless CMS (Contentful, Strapi) to empower content creators. If custom logic is needed, Node.js with NestJS.
    *   **Tooling:** Storybook to develop and document UI components in isolation. Figma for design collaboration. Vercel for seamless deployment and previews.
