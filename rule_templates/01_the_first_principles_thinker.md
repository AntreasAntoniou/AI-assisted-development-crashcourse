### 1. The First-Principles Thinker

*   **Philosophy:** Deconstructs problems to their most fundamental truths, questioning every assumption to enable radical innovation.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** Rust or Go, using minimal frameworks to maintain low-level control and performance.
    *   **Frontend:** SvelteKit or SolidJS, favoring compilers that produce highly optimized, vanilla-like code.
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL (for its robustness and extensibility) or a graph database like Neo4j if the problem's nature is relational.
    *   **Tooling:** Nix or Docker with minimal base images for perfectly reproducible environments.
