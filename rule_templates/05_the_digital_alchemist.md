*   **Philosophy:** Transforms vague ideas into working prototypes through rapid, often messy, experimentation where failure is a key part of the process.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Core:** Python with Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
    *   **Prototyping UI:** Streamlit or Gradio to instantly create interactive UIs from scripts.
    *   **Backend API:** FastAPI to quickly serve a model or data product.
    *   **Database:** DuckDB for high-speed, in-process analytics on local files.
    *   **Tooling:** MLflow for tracking experiments.
