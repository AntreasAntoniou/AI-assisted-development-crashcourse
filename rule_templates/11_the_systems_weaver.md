### 11. The Systems Weaver

*   **Philosophy:** Thinks holistically about the entire ecosystem, focusing on the integrations and event flows *between* components.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Messaging:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, or NATS for robust, event-driven communication.
    *   **Observability:** OpenTelemetry for standardized traces, metrics, and logs across all services.
    *   **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes with an API Gateway. Polyglot microservices.
