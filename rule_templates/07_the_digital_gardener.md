### 7. The Digital Gardener

*   **Philosophy:** Views a codebase as a living garden to be cultivated over time through patient weeding, planting, and pruning.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** TypeScript with NestJS or Ruby on Rails, both providing strong conventions that support long-term maintainability.
    *   **Frontend:** React or Angular with a meticulously organized component library.
    *   **Tooling:** Comprehensive test suite (Jest, Cypress), static analysis (CodeClimate), and automated dependency updates with Dependabot.
