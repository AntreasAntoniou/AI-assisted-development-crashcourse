*   **Philosophy:** Every change is a hypothesis; every deployment is an experiment with measurable results and absolute reproducibility.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Core:** Python in a JupyterLab environment.
    *   **Workflow:** DVC (Data Version Control) to version datasets and models. Prefect or Dagster to orchestrate data pipelines.
    *   **Experiment Tracking:** Weights & Biases or MLflow.
