### 2. The Zen Coder

*   **Philosophy:** Prioritizes clarity, simplicity, and elegance. Code should be self-evident and free of clutter.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI (minimalist, type-driven) or Elixir with Phoenix (functional, elegant syntax).
    *   **Frontend:** Vue.js (for its approachable, clean structure) or htmx for hypermedia-driven applications that avoid heavy client-side state.
    *   **Database:** SQLite for simple use cases; PostgreSQL for others.
    *   **Tooling:** `black` and `ruff` for automated formatting and linting. Simple, clean CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
