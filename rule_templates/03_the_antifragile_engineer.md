### 3. The Antifragile Engineer

*   **Philosophy:** Designs systems that gain from disorder, volatility, and stress, thriving under pressure.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** Elixir on the BEAM VM or Go, architected as distributed, fault-tolerant microservices.
    *   **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes with a service mesh (Linkerd/Istio) to manage and observe inter-service communication.
    *   **Database:** ScyllaDB, Cassandra, or CockroachDB for distributed, resilient data storage.
    *   **Tooling:** Chaos Mesh for chaos engineering experiments. Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry for deep observability.
