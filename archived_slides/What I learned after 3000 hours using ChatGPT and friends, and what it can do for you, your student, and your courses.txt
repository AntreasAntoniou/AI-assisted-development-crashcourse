A metric created for this talk …IIU (Intuitiveness, Informativeness, and Usefulness)
"Intuitiveness"
How naturally does the model interact?
Can it understand and respond accurately?
Take note: 'Intuition' in AI is about simulating understanding.
"Informativeness"
Does it provide detailed, relevant information?
How dense is the value per token?
Remember: Informative does not equal truthful.
"Usefulness"
Are the responses beneficial and actionable?
Is the returned content aligned with the user's immediate needs?
Caveat: Usefulness is subjective and context-dependent.
Bottom line: IIU is a subjective metric, capturing my experience working with these tools.

Models Used - Pros and Cons
GPT 3.5 Turbo 15K: Extremely fast speed, IIU Rating of 4.0/10, High cost-effectiveness, Wide availability through General API.
Gemini Pro: Similar performance to GPT 3.5 Turbo, accessible to all via gemini.google.com
GPT 4 8K & Vision Variant: Fast speed (Moderate for Vision), IIU Rating of 7.5/10 (8.0/10 for Vision), Medium cost-effectiveness, Limited availability (API only).
GPT 4 32K: Moderate speed, IIU Rating of 8.5/10, Low cost-effectiveness, Limited availability.
GPT 4 Turbo 128K & Vision Variant: Extremely fast speed, IIU Rating of 6/10 (6.5/10 for Vision), High cost-effectiveness, Broad availability.
Gemini Ultra: Comparable to GPT 4 128K but with 31K context, and built in search, Paid membership.

Most of my experience is hence on …
GPT4 8K (sometimes with Vision)
GPT4 32K - when more context awareness is key to a task
GPT 4 Turbo 128K - For less professional tasks
Gemini Ultra: Used more recently, and found to perform comparatively to 1, but have less than 50 hours on it.

Problems I encountered
Forgetfulness: Tends to forget or lose track of the context at times, requiring frequent reminders of earlier content.
Varying Competence
Large-Scale Coding
‘Placeholder’ Coding: GPT-4 seems to sometimes fall into a state of offering placeholders and pseudocode, and won’t write the code you request.
Coherence over longer context (2K +)
Most responses are 90% ‘ready to go’, but skip the ‘human supervision’ and it can lead to that 10% leaking out as incompetence 
– It’s an incredible tool, but it is still a tool. You, the human, are the driver, and must ‘manage’ the tool, and take responsibility for its outputs. 
Forgetfulness: GPT-4 tends to forget or lose track of the context at times, requiring frequent reminders of earlier content.
Varying Competence: GPT-4's capability can be inconsistent, ranging from genius/insightful to seemingly "dumb", which can disrupt smooth operation.
Large-Scale Coding: GPT-4 struggled with large-scale modifications, such as reorganizing whole repositories, or even just large code files.
‘Placeholder’ Coding: GPT-4 seems to sometimes fall into a state of offering placeholders and pseudocode, and won’t write the code you request.
Coherence over longer context: In stories, conversations, lyrics, code after say 2K tokens of so, it becomes clear that coherence is lackluster sometimes.
While a great information source, and even a skill-training source, for mental health and interpersonal matters. A human touch is necessary to ensure it’s going the right way.

Tips and tricks to improve probability of useful application of the tools
Dealing with these systems is a bit like cooking. The below form my current best recipe. But take with a grain of salt, and adapt based on context.
Detailed Instructions: Create detailed, specific instructions for each use scenario, what to do and what not to.
Collaboration with AI: View AI as a collaborator, correcting and guiding it as necessary.
Mind Your Phrasing: Tone and style influence AI responses. Make your requests accordingly.
Iteration is Key: Enhancing efficiency may require trial and error. Be patient and willing to adjust.
Employ Meta-Prompting: Improve performance by thinking a layer above. Ask the AI about the best way to phrase a task.

Dealing with these systems is a bit like cooking. The below form my current best recipe. But take with a grain of salt, and adapt based on context.
The “System Instruction Prompt” – You should write in here, in high detail what you want your agent to know, do, not do, during any and all interactions. You should probably craft this using a tool like GPT4, and you should have one for each scenario in which you want to use GPT4.
Treat it as a collaboration and a conversation at all times. The agent will try to be helpful, and it will be good enough, or awesome, in many things, but will also get some others terrible or unacceptable. Tell it about it when it does, and help steer it to what you need. – Tis all about the dance.
The way you phrase your queries matters. Your tone, style, stance will change the way it responds. It was trained on human data. Humans respond differently to tone, style, stance etc. It will be imitating that. 
Remember that the process of achieving the 3-5x efficiency improvement at a given task can be a bit of a ‘mining’ process. You will need to add ingredients, stir, and then try stirring differently with new ingredients if it doesn’t work. Sometimes you just get bad RNG too!
If you don’t know how you get the tool to do what you want - ASK IT how you can get it to do what you want! 
You will notice that often one of the most powerful mental models for this is a ‘meta’ one. You can almost always improve the tools performance by thinking a layer above and asking it how you can ask it to do what you want it to do.

Coding: Copilot Vs ChatGPT4
Tips:
Use comments as the means to prompt Copilot
Copilot is aware of the whole file, and is biased towards recent code, use this to achieve what you need
Copilot offers a chat interface, docstring generation etc. 
Copilot chat is more limited than ChatGPT4
Use ChatGPT4 to discuss software architecture, efficiency, write longer code segments
Use Copilot for quick, in-place coding, docstrings, and chat-based method/class generation
